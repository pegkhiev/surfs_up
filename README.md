# Background
The challenge is to identify the statistical data in June and December across all stations and to analyse any difference between the two months of the year. 

## Note to Grader: 
The challege itself says to identify the statistical data in June and Dec across ALL years, but our TA indicated that it should only be for 2016 - 2017.  I therefore produced two sets of results, one for all years (2010 - 2017) and one for 2016-2017.  

However, as the data reveals, there is no data for data for Dec 2017, so the two sets of results are: 
- A) 2010-2017 June vs 2010-2016 Dec 
- B) 2016-2017 June vs 2016 Dec 

# A) 2010-2017 June vs 2010-2016 Dec

### Observations: 
- For both months, the data is heavily skewed to the right, with <=25% of days with heavier rain, and 50% of days with no or very light rain. 
- Dec showed 60% higher in mean precipation than June, and the max precipation is also 45% higher.  So Dec is a rainier month than June.
- In terms of temperature, both months do not show significant difference.  The mean temperature in Dec is 3° lower though the lowest temperature variance is higher.  Yet as the mean is very close to 50% percentile for both months, the data is relatively evenly distributed so there are likely to be very few days where the Dec temperatures are as low as 56°.

### Further analysis 
- Study further if the max precipitation in June and Dec are outliers 
- Study further the temperature across all months to see if there are any colder months than Dec that might prohibit surfing.
- Study further the weather statistics in the exact location where the store is planned.

# B) 2016-2017 June vs 2016 Dec

### Observations: 
- For 2016-2017, compared to the 8-year period, the data is still skewed to the right but not as heavy. Over 75% of days have below-average or slightly higher-than-average precipation. 
- Dec is still a rainer month with the mean precipitation 20% higher than June, and the max precipitation almost 40% higher 
- Dec is 5° lower than June in average based on the mean temperature. 

### Further analysis 
- Study further if the max precipitation in June and Dec are outliers 
- Study further the temperature across all years to see if the trend in 2016-2017 is normal or exceptional.
